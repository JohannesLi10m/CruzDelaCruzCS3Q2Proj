    <h1>F1: Its History and Origins</h1>
    <p>
        Origins: F1's first every Grand Prix was in 1950, Silverstone, but, before this, F1 was just an idea, just a dream that every driver wants to take part in, it all starts in 1904, when the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile was founded, they are the governing body of Motorsport Racing, it then proceeds to 1906 when the words "Grand Prix" was made, it meant "Big Prize" in French. The Grand Prix name was used for races like the Le Mans series in the early 20th century, it was then used for other open-cockpit, long distance races like the Formula series. Formula is the term for rules and regulations made to be followed by the various teams who are gonna compete in the sport, their cars must fit the Formula, otherwise they will get a points penalty or a disqualification from the Championship. In the 1930's, a Formula One World Championship series was discussed and was almost done, until it got shelved because of WWII. After WWII, in 1946, the plans for a Formula One World Championship series was discussed again which then led to the first ever Grand Prix in 1950.

                Most tracks are laid out with Hay Bales to cushion impact, but have high flammability. No Safety Car yet, race continues even if there is a crash, and most drivers race helmet-less and seatbelt-less.
