            These are the teams that make up the sport as Constructors, they fight for entertainemtn and to win the Constructor's Championship.

        <img src="../asset/Ferrari.png" height="250" alt="trash" title="Ferrari">
        <h1>Scuderia Ferrari HP</h1>
        <p>Ferrari, F1's oldest and most competitive team, they have the record amount of 15 Constructor's and 16 Driver's Championships won. They started in 1950, they were supposed to be racing cars made by Alfa Romeo, but instead chose to build their cars for the sport, though having an unsuccessful first season in F1, they did win their first Grand Prix in 1951 at the British Grand Prix(Silverstone). Over the course of a few years, they had a few ups, like Niki Lauda winning the 1975 World Driver's Championship, or the 5 WDC's that Michael Schumacher won in a row from 2000-2004, but also a few downs, like when Niki Lauda almost got killed in a racing accident at the Nürburgring Nordschleife, or when Ferrari kept losing to Renault, Mercedes, and Red Bull in the V8 and V6 Hybrid era, with Kimi Raikkonen winning them their ast World Driver's Championship(2007) and thei latest Constructor's Championship(2008), or when they built the F14T which understeered into corners and then would oversteer going out of the said corners, or the time when Charles Leclerc got so close to winning the Championships in 2022 and 2024 but missed out because of the Team Strategy problems.</p>
        <img src="../asset/Red Bull.png" height="250" alt="TUTUTURU" title="Red Bull">
        <h1>Oracle Red Bull Racing</h1>
        <p>Red Bull, one of the best teams on the grid, they have shown that they are capable of winning multiple Championships with the likes of Max Verstappen and Sebastian Vettel each winning 4 in a row. They started out as the Jaguar Racing team, which then struggled to compete in F1 after the end of the 1990's, they were bought out by Red Bull, which then turned the team into "Red Bull Racing", they have become one of the most successful modern-day F1 teams. They had many ups, and as many downs, like Vettel and Verstappen's 4 WDC's won each, but also their failures in the first few years of the team existing, and the V6-Hybrid era. Currently, it is going downhill so far, in 2025, the RB21 struggled a lot because of aero and power unit problems, eventually, they lost the Constructor of 2025 to McLaren who also had Lando Norris win his first WDC and break Max's supposed to be 5th WDC in a row, which would've tied the achievement of Michael Schumacher. The early successes of Red Bull was because of people like their former Team Principle Christian Horner, and their head of car design and aero dynamics, Adrian Newey, both of which got fired, or left the team due to controversial reasons.</p>
        <img src="../asset/Mercedes.jpeg" height="250" alt="Taliban" title="Mercedes">
        <h1>Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team</h1>
        <p>Mercedes, orginally joined F1 as a Constructor in 1954, dominated with Juan Manuel Fangio, but left after the 1955 season because of "The Le Mans Disaster of 1955". They began sponsoring and building engines for F1 cars starting in the late 80's/early 90's, but fully came back as a Constructor in the 2010 season after buying out Brawn GP. Mercedes' first drivers were Nico Rosberg, and 7-time WDC Michael Schumacher, thoug having two legendary drivers, they didn't win a championship until Hamilton came to the team, from 2014-2020, Mercedes dominated the sport, winning both Driver's and Constructor's Championships from those 7 consecutive years the streak would end when Max Verstappen wins the WDC in 2021, in 2022, Mercedes replaced legendary driver Valtteri Bottas with George Russell, this was also the start of Hamilton's decline from being at the top, he would go lower and lower in the Championship standings, eventually, Lewis Hamilton departs from Mercedes, going to Ferrari. In the 2025 season, Mercedes finished with the 2nd spot in the Constructor's Championship after McLaren, with a talented driver in George Russell and a young rookie in Kimi Antonelli, this team can definitely win more in the future.</p>
        <img src="../asset/McLaren.png" height="150" alt="Favoritism" title="McLaren">
        <h1>McLaren Formula One Team</h1>
        <p>McLaren, started racing in F1 in 1966 with their founder Bruce McLaren racing for them. They won their first race in 1968 at the Belgian Gran Prix. McLaren would win a Constructor's and Driver's Championship in 1974 with driver Emerson Fittipaldi, though sadly Bruce McLaren would never see this as he would die in 1970 testing a Can-Am prototype. Over the years, McLaren would win more and more championships with the likes of Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, Mika Hakkinen, Lewis Hamilton, and currently Lando Norris. There are still some bad times however, like the 2010's McLaren-Honda era when Fernando Alonso and his co-drivers got frustrated becaue of the unreliable Honda engines and horrible aerodynamics of the McLaren cars. But in 2024, McLaren finally won another Constructor's Championship after defeating Red Bull, and currently in 2025, they won both WDC and WCC with Lando Norris earning his first ever Driver's Championship.</p>
        <img src="../asset/Williams.png" height="250" alt="Carlbono" title="Williams">
        <h1>Atlassian Williams Racing</h1>
        <p>Williams, one of the most iconic teams in F1's history, they have been in the midfield since the start of the new century, but, they used to have the best technologies back in the 80's and 90's. Williams joined the sport in 1977, with them winning their first Grand Prix 2 years later in 1979, they then won their first Driver's and Constructor's Championship in 1980 with Alan Jones. In the 1980's they would mostly be a top team, with the latter half of the 1980's and early 1990's, they would make technology that was very advanced at the time, they made many driver-assists like the paddle shifters, active suspension, and traction control. Williams would mostly dominate the 1990's with them winning 4 Driver's Championships and 5 Constructor's Championships. Sadly, in 1994 one of their most talented drivers, Ayrton Senna died at the San Marino Grand Prix after his Williams' steering column broke causing him to hit the wall at the Tamburello corner, the suspension of his Williams hit his helmet at a high force instantly killing him. Williams would still win the 1994 Constructor's Championship after Senna's death, but it was still overshadowed by the event. In the 2000's Williams eventually lost a hold of their supporters and their only hope was with BMW, but they didn't win a championship in that decade. In the 2010's Williams was gradually going down the grid as they get overshadowed by other more promising teams, drivers usually skip over them when choosing which team to negotiate with a contract because they fell behind in the aero department with focusing on straight-line speed, and because they couldn't get the hang of the treands and regulations. Right now, Williams is still a midfield team, but with drivers like Carlos Sainz Jr. and Alex Albon, they are trying to do more with less, infact, they are beating other teams who have an advantage aginst them, like more funding.   </p>
        <img src="../asset/Aston Martin.jpg" height="250" alt="Nando" title="aston Martin">
        <h1>Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team</h1>
        <p>Aston Martin, they originally joined F1 in 1959, but left because of bad results just a year later. They then came back as a Constructor in 2021, replacing Racing Point. They have multiple podium finishes in 2022 and 2023, but when upgrading the car, they actually downgrade it causing to slower times. As of 2025, Aston Martin is a bottom to midfield team, while they have a legendary driver in Fernando Alonso, their car is very unreliable, and the durability of the Power Unit is below average, as it usually breaks before the end of the race. </p>
        <img src="../asset/Haas.png" height="250" alt="Steiner" title="Haas">
        <h1>Moneygram Haas</h1>
        <p>Haas, the most recent US-led team to join F1, they began racing in 2016 with drivers Roman Grosjean, and Esteban Gutierrez. They were consistent from 2016-2018, but then became lackluster and were listed as a backmarker in 2019 and 2020 because of their poor aerodynamics. In 2020, Roman Grosjean crashed at Bahrain causing his car to split in half and burst in a fireball, he barely managed to survived thanks to the safety equipment in use. Sadly that would be his last race in F1 as he retired form the sport. In 2021, Haas decided to get a fresh start. They laid off driver Kevin Magnussen for rookies Mick Schumacher, son of Michael Schumacher, and Nikita Mazepin, the result, 2021 ended with them not scoring points and getting 10th in the Constructor's. In 2022, they laid off Mazepin to get Kevin Magnussen back, they were still lackluster as they still finished last in the Constructor's. In 2023 and 2024, their performance improved a little with the likes of Nico Hulkenber and Kevin Magnussen. Currently, they did above average in 2025 resulting in a 8th position for Constructor's and they were just 10 points short of tying Aston Martin.</p>
        <img src="../asset/Audi.png" height="250" alt="HULKENBERG" title="Audi">
        <h1>Audi Revolut F1 Team</h1>
        <p>Audi Revolut, one of the two newest teams in F1, having replaced Kick Stake Sauber. Sauber was once a good midfield team in the late 2000's, but fell off when their partnership with BMW ended. The current drivers for Audi are Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto.</p>
        <img src="../asset/Alpine.webp" height ="350" alt="Boat" title="Alpine">
        <h1>BWT Alpine Formula One Team</h1>
        <p>Alpine, started off as Renault in 1977, they introduced the turbocharged engines to F1, over the years Renault had won multiple Championships, most notably from Fernando Alonso in 2005 and 2006. After re-buying Lotus, Renault struggled in the V6-Hybrid era, against teams like Red Bull and Mercedes, Renault was very below average. In 2021, Renault renamed themselves as "Alpine" to promote their sports car brand of the same name. Currently, they're having a very bad season finishing 10th in the Constructor's Championship, with Pierre Gasly barely scoring any points, and their rookie driver Franco Colapinto scoring none.</p>
        <img src="../asset/Racing Bulls.svg" height="250" alt="Better than Red Bull" title="Racing Bulls">

Drivers like Sebastian Vettel, Mark Webber, Max Verstappen, Carlos Sainz, all came from this team before graduating to Red Bull or going to other bigger teams. Their last win is from 2020 when Pierre Gasly drove for them.</p>
