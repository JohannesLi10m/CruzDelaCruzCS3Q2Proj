        <p>Ferrari, F1's oldest and most competitive team, they have the record amount of 15 Constructor's and 16 Driver's Championships won. They started in 1950, they were supposed to be racing cars made by Alfa Romeo, but instead chose to build their cars for the sport, though having an unsuccessful first season in F1, they did win their first Grand Prix in 1951 at the British Grand Prix(Silverstone). Over the course of a few years, they had a few ups, like Niki Lauda winning the 1975 World Driver's Championship, or the 5 WDC's that Michael Schumacher won in a row from 2000-2004, but also a few downs, like when Niki Lauda almost got killed in a racing accident at the Nürburgring Nordschleife, or when Ferrari kept losing to Renault, Mercedes, and Red Bull in the V8 and V6 Hybrid era, with Kimi Raikkonen winning them their ast World Driver's Championship(2007) and thei latest Constructor's Championship(2008), or when they built the F14T which understeered into corners and then would oversteer going out of the said corners, or the time when Charles Leclerc got so close to winning the Championships in 2022 and 2024 but missed out because of the Team Strategy problems. </p>
